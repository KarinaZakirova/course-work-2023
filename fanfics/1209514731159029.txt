They say I'm etcetera, is it a true?
They say there's nothing with me to do
If I were them, I would rather die
Than think up my tainted pride

Maybe I'm sick, maybe I'm gone
Maybe I'm searching for the gold
Maybe I'm dead, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm just reaching for my own

What a surprise! Lovely pain
Loves coming to me like every day
They don't understand much 'bout me
But already know that problems exist

Maybe I'm done, maybe I'm ghost
Maybe these walls somewhen will fall
Maybe I'm fed up, maybe I'm wasted
Maybe I've worn myself out too long
